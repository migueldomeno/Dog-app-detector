# Deep-Learning-Udacity Dog App

Dog breed classifier computer vision project using a CNN transfer learning for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. 
With this model I reached 79% accuracy.

Getting Started:

Step 1: Review my code and results in dog_app.ipynb.

Step 2: Do this project yourself
To make your own Dog App review the project requirements, go here and follow the instructions in the ReadMe.

Prerequisites:

The dog dataset. (“Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages. The dogImages/ folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.” – @udacity)
The human dataset. (“Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/lfw.” -@udacity)
Pytorch and Torchvision. For installation instructions see Udacity's Readme in the Deep Learning repository.
Your own images. I recommend at least 2 test images in each of the following categories: dogs, humans, cats, other. Each image should be center-cropped and no image should contain both a dog and a human.
